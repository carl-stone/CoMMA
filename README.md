# CoMMA: Comparative adenine methylomics between bacterial samples

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CoMMA is designed to take bacterial methylation calls from nanopore
sequencing data then characterize methylation throughout the genome,
identify differentially methylated sites between samples, and compare
adenine methylomes between samples.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CoMMA from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("carl-stone/CoMMA")
```
