# TSS-centered methylation profile

Plots individual methylation sites at their absolute base-pair position
relative to the nearest transcription start site (TSS), showing the raw
spatial distribution of methylation around gene starts. Optionally
colours sites by regulatory feature overlap (e.g., sigma factor binding
sites, \\-10\\/\\-35\\ elements, transcription factor binding sites).

## Usage

``` r
plot_tss_profile(
  object,
  feature_type = "gene",
  window = 500L,
  regulatory_feature_types = NULL,
  mod_type = NULL,
  motif = NULL,
  mod_context = NULL,
  color_by = c("sample", "regulatory_element", "mod_type", "mod_context", "none"),
  facet_by = c("none", "sample", "mod_type", "mod_context"),
  alpha = 0.4,
  show_smooth = FALSE,
  smooth_span = 0.3
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A
  [`commaData`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/commaData.md)
  object with a non-empty `annotation` slot.

- feature_type:

  Character string specifying the feature type whose start coordinate
  defines the TSS (e.g., `"gene"`, `"CDS"`). Must match a value in the
  `feature_type` metadata column of `annotation(object)`. Default
  `"gene"`.

- window:

  Positive integer. Half-window size in base pairs around the TSS. Sites
  beyond `window` bp upstream or downstream of every TSS are excluded.
  Default `500L`.

- regulatory_feature_types:

  Character vector or `NULL`. Feature types from `annotation(object)`
  used to label sites when `color_by = "regulatory_element"` (e.g.,
  `c("sigma_binding", "promoter_-10", "promoter_-35", "TF_binding")`).
  Required when `color_by = "regulatory_element"`; ignored otherwise.

- mod_type:

  Character string or `NULL`. If provided, only sites of the specified
  modification type (e.g., `"6mA"`, `"5mC"`) are included.

- motif:

  Character vector or `NULL`. If provided, only sites with the specified
  sequence motif(s) are included.

- mod_context:

  Character vector or `NULL`. If provided, only sites whose
  `mod_context` rowData column matches one of the supplied values are
  included. If `NULL` (default), all modification contexts are included.

- color_by:

  Character string controlling the colour aesthetic:

  `"sample"`

  :   One colour per sample (default).

  `"regulatory_element"`

  :   Sites coloured by the first regulatory feature they overlap (from
      `regulatory_feature_types`); sites with no overlap are labelled
      `"None"` and shown in grey. Requires `regulatory_feature_types`.

  `"mod_type"`

  :   One colour per modification type.

  `"mod_context"`

  :   One colour per modification context.

  `"none"`

  :   No colour mapping; all points drawn in the default colour. Useful
      when `facet_by` provides sufficient grouping.

- facet_by:

  Character string controlling optional faceting: `"none"` (default),
  `"sample"`, `"mod_type"`, or `"mod_context"`.

- alpha:

  Numeric in \\(0, 1\]\\. Point transparency. Default `0.4`.

- show_smooth:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, a loess smoothing line is overlaid per colour
  group. Default `FALSE`.

- smooth_span:

  Numeric in \\(0, 1\]\\. Loess span parameter passed to
  [`loess`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/loess.html). Default `0.3`.

## Value

A [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html)
object. The x-axis shows signed position relative to the TSS in base
pairs; the y-axis shows methylation beta value (0–1). A dashed vertical
line marks the TSS at x = 0.

## Details

Unlike
[`plot_metagene`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_metagene.md),
which normalises positions to \\\[0, 1\]\\ and averages across sites,
`plot_tss_profile` shows every individual site at its exact signed
base-pair distance from the nearest TSS (negative = upstream, positive =
downstream). This preserves the absolute spacing of promoter elements
relative to the start of transcription.

Internally calls
[`annotateSites`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/annotateSites.md)`(keep = "proximity")`
to compute signed TSS distances. Strand awareness follows the same
convention: for `+` strand features, position 0 is the lowest
coordinate; for `-` strand features, position 0 is the highest
coordinate (the biological TSS). When a site is within `window` bp of
multiple TSS features, only the nearest (by absolute distance) is used.

If `color_by = "regulatory_element"` and none of the specified
`regulatory_feature_types` are found in `annotation(object)`, the
function issues a message and falls back to `color_by = "sample"` so the
plot still renders.

# Colour by modification type, facet by sample

# Overlay loess smooth
plot_tss_profile(comma_example_data, feature_type = "gene",
                 show_smooth = TRUE)
#> Warning: LOESS smooth for group(s) 'ctrl_1', 'ctrl_2', 'ctrl_3', 'treat_1', 'treat_2', 'treat_3' encountered numerical instability; the smooth may be unreliable. Consider adjusting smooth_span or increasing data density near this feature.
