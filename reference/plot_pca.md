# PCA of methylation profiles

Performs principal component analysis (PCA) on per-sample methylation
profiles and plots PC1 vs PC2. Useful for sample-level QC, detecting
outliers, and assessing whether biological conditions separate in
methylation space.

## Usage

``` r
plot_pca(
  object,
  mod_type = NULL,
  motif = NULL,
  mod_context = NULL,
  color_by = "condition",
  shape_by = NULL,
  return_data = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A
  [`commaData`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/commaData.md)
  object.

- mod_type:

  Character string specifying a single modification type (e.g., `"6mA"`,
  `"5mC"`). If `NULL` (default), all sites from all modification types
  are used.

- motif:

  Character vector or `NULL`. If provided, only sites with matching
  sequence context motif(s) are included (e.g., `"GATC"`). If `NULL`
  (default), all motifs are included.

- color_by:

  Character string naming a column in `sampleInfo(object)` to use for
  point color. Default `"condition"`.

- shape_by:

  Character string naming a column in `sampleInfo(object)` to use for
  point shape. If `NULL` (default), all points use the same shape.
  Ignored when `return_data = TRUE`.

- return_data:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, return the underlying scores `data.frame` instead
  of a ggplot object. Useful for building custom plots. Default `FALSE`.

## Value

When `return_data = FALSE` (default), a
[`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) object.
PC1 and PC2 are shown on the x- and y-axes, respectively, with
percentage of variance explained in the axis labels. Each point
represents one sample and is labeled with its `sample_name`. Points are
colored by `color_by`.

When `return_data = TRUE`, a `data.frame` with one row per sample
containing columns `PC1`, `PC2`, `sample_name`, and all columns from
`sampleInfo(object)`. The attribute `percentVar` (accessible via
`attr(result, "percentVar")`) is a named numeric vector giving the
percentage of variance explained by PC1 and PC2.

## Details

Beta values are first converted to M-values via
[`mValues`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/mValues.md)
(using `alpha = 0.5`) before PCA. M-values are variance-stabilized
relative to raw beta values, making distance-based analyses more
reliable especially when many sites are near 0 or 1. Sites with any `NA`
M-values across samples (including sites with zero coverage) are removed
to ensure a complete data matrix. PCA is computed via
[`stats::prcomp`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/prcomp.html) with centering
(`center = TRUE`) and without scaling (`scale. = FALSE`). A warning is
issued if fewer than three samples are present.

## Examples

``` r
data(comma_example_data)
plot_pca(comma_example_data)


# Color by condition, shape by replicate
plot_pca(comma_example_data, color_by = "condition")


# Only 6mA sites
plot_pca(comma_example_data, mod_type = "6mA")


# Return data for custom plotting
d <- plot_pca(comma_example_data, return_data = TRUE)
attr(d, "percentVar")  # variance explained by PC1, PC2
#>  PC1  PC2 
#> 49.6 14.6 
```
