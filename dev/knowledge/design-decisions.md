This document records significant architectural and API decisions. When you're tempted to change something, check here first to understand why it was designed this way.

## D-001: diffMethyl loops by mod_context, not mod_type

**Decision:** Differential methylation tests each `mod_context` (mod_type × motif combination) independently, not each `mod_type`.

**Rationale:** Different modification contexts are biologically distinct. 6mA at GATC (Dam methyltransferase) and 6mA at ACCACC (Cellulomonas-specific) are not the same signal. Pooling them would create spurious associations.

**Example:**
- `6mA_GATC` — 393 sites, tested separately
- `5mC_CCWGG` — 195 sites, tested separately
- A site that's `6mA_GATC` is NOT tested in the `5mC_CCWGG` model

**Consequence:** Multiple testing correction is genome-wide across all mod_contexts, not per-mod_type.

**Do not change without:** Understanding the statistical implications and consulting Carl.

## D-002: Effect sizes on beta scale (0-1), not M-value scale

**Decision:** `dm_delta_beta` is always reported on the beta scale (0-1), even when the backend uses M-values internally (limma method).

**Rationale:** Biologists think in methylation percentages. A delta_beta of 0.2 means "20 percentage points difference" — intuitive. M-values are log-odds and harder to interpret.

**Consequence:** Limma backend transforms back to beta scale after fitting on M-values.

**Do not change:** User-facing results must always be on beta scale.

## D-003: Multiple testing correction is genome-wide

**Decision:** All p-values from `diffMethyl()` are corrected together across all mod_contexts in a single call to `p.adjust()`.

**Rationale:** Each site is a hypothesis test. The family of tests is all sites tested in that `diffMethyl()` call. Correcting per-mod_context would artificially lower the bar for rare modifications.

**Consequence:** If you have 393 6mA sites and 195 5mC sites, all 588 p-values are corrected together.

**Do not change without:** Statistical justification and consulting Carl.

## D-004: annotateSites uses list-columns (CharacterList/IntegerList/NumericList)

**Decision:** `annotateSites()` stores all overlapping/nearby features per site as list-columns, not a single match per site.

**Rationale:** Bacterial genomes are densely annotated. A single site can overlap a gene, a promoter, a TF binding site, and an operon. Forcing a single match loses information.

**Consequence:**
- `feature_types`, `feature_names`, `rel_position`, `frac_position` are all list-columns
- Intergenic sites have length-0 entries (test with `lengths(col) == 0`)
- Never revert to `!duplicated()` or `distanceToNearest()` single-match

**Do not change:** This is core to how annotation works. The test suite enforces list-column types.

## D-005: enrichment supports gene_role = target/regulator/both

**Decision:** `enrichMethylation()` distinguishes between target genes (where DM sites overlap gene bodies) and regulator genes (whose products bind near DM sites).

**Rationale:** Methylation can affect gene expression (target) or protein binding (regulator). These are different biological questions with different background universes.

**Consequence:**
- `gene_role = "target"` — background is all genes in annotation
- `gene_role = "regulator"` — background is only regulators of that type (e.g., sigma factors)
- `gene_role = "both"` — runs both analyses separately

**Do not change:** The semantics are intentional and documented.

## D-006: KEGG uses offline path with 2 bulk API calls

**Decision:** KEGG enrichment should use pre-built term-to-gene mappings via `buildKEGGTermGene()` and `buildKEGGGeneIDMap()`, not fire one HTTP request per pathway.

**Rationale:** KEGG REST API has rate limits. A typical organism has 100+ pathways. One request per pathway exceeds limits and crashes the analysis.

**Implementation:**
1. `buildKEGGTermGene(organism)` — fires 2 API calls total, caches to RDS
2. `buildKEGGGeneIDMap(organism)` — fires 1 API call, caches to RDS
3. `enrichMethylation(kegg_term2gene = ...)` — uses offline mapping, no network

**Do not change:** The offline path is the recommended approach. Online path exists but is fragile.

## D-007: commaData extends SummarizedExperiment

**Decision:** The core data container is an S4 class extending `SummarizedExperiment`.

**Rationale:** Idiomatic for Bioconductor. Users familiar with DESeq2, edgeR, or other Bioc packages will recognize the pattern. Enables reuse of Bioc infrastructure (rowRanges, colData, assays).

**Consequence:**
- `methylation()` and `coverage()` are assay accessors
- `rowData()` holds per-site metadata
- `colData()` holds per-sample metadata
- `genome()` and `annotation()` are custom slots

**Do not change:** Core to the package architecture.

## D-008: Modification-type agnostic by design

**Decision:** Every function must work for 6mA, 5mC, 4mC, and any future modification type. No hardcoding for specific types.

**Rationale:** The field is evolving. New modifications (e.g., phosphorothioate) may become relevant. The package should not assume a fixed set.

**Consequence:**
- No `if (mod_type == "6mA")` special cases in core logic
- `modTypes(object)` returns what's present, not a fixed list
- Statistical backends must handle any mod_type string

**Do not change:** This is a core design principle.

---

## D-009: Genome size from genomeInfo, never hardcoded

**Decision:** Any function that needs chromosome length must get it from `genomeInfo(object)`, never hardcode values.

**Rationale:** Different organisms have different genomes. Hardcoding E. coli values would break for Helicobacter or Mycobacterium.

**Consequence:**
- `slidingWindow()` uses `genomeInfo()` for boundary handling
- `plot_genome_track()` uses `genomeInfo()` for axis limits
- Tests use synthetic 100 kb chromosome, not real values

**Do not change:** This is a core design principle.

---

## D-010: Parameter naming convention

**Decision:**
- Analysis functions: `verbNoun()` camelCase (e.g., `annotateSites`, `diffMethyl`)
- Plot functions: `plot_noun()` snake_case (e.g., `plot_volcano`, `plot_pca`)
- Arguments: snake_case (e.g., `mod_type`, `min_coverage`)
- Internal functions: `.` prefix (e.g., `.parseBetaValues`)

**Rationale:** Follows established R conventions. Analysis functions are actions, plots are nouns, arguments are descriptive.

**Do not change:** Consistency matters for user experience.

## How to Add New Decisions

When making a significant design or API decision:

1. Add an entry with format `D-NNN: Title`
2. Include: Decision, Rationale, Consequence, "Do not change without"
3. Cross-reference related decisions if applicable
4. Update this document, not just code comments

This document is the source of truth for "why did we do it this way."
