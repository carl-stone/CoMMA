## Tactical Work: GitHub Issues & PRs

**The tactical source of truth for current work is [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/carl-stone/CoMMA/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/carl-stone/CoMMA/pulls).**

If you want to know what is happening, what needs to be done, or what is blocked — go to GitHub Issues. That is where tasks live, get labeled, and get tracked.

Labels follow a namespaced scheme:

| Namespace | Labels | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `type:` | `bug`, `docs`, `test`, `cleanup`, `api`, `data`, `audit`, `admin` | What kind of work |
| `area:` | `import`, `diffMethyl`, `plots`, `slidingWindow`, `enrichment`, `bioconductor`, `pm` | Which package area |
| `priority:` | `high`, `medium`, `low` | Urgency |
| `status:` | `blocked`, `needs-decision`, `accepted` | Workflow state |

## Strategic & Context Documents

These files are still maintained in `dev/`:

| Question | Read this |
|----------|-----------|
| Where is the package going? | `ROADMAP.md` |
| What is v1.0 supposed to be? | `PRD.md` |
| What is the dream version? | `VISION.md` |
| How should Claire learn the package? | `ONBOARDING.md` |

---

## Durable Knowledge (`knowledge/`)

Organized by topic, not by date. When commaBot learns something durable, it goes here.

| File | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `test-quality.md` | What tests are strong, weak, or missing |
| `known-issues.md` | Bugs, gotchas, edge cases |
| `design-decisions.md` | Why important decisions were made |
| `git-discipline.md` | How commits, staging, generated files, and local state are handled |
| `branching-releases.md` | Branch, PR, release, tag, and version policy |

---

## Archive (`archive/`)

Historical documents that are no longer active but should not be deleted. These are preserved for reference only — do not update them.

| File | Why it was archived |
|------|-------------------|
| `BACKLOG.md` | Pre-GitHub-Issues task tracking. Migrated to GitHub Issues 2026-05-15. |
| `STATUS.md` | Pre-GitHub-Issues sprint board. Migrated to GitHub Issues 2026-05-15. |
| `AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md` | One-time agent setup instructions, no longer needed. |
| `SPECS.md` | Resolved implementation spec. |

## For commaBot

When doing project-management work:

1. **GitHub Issues** is the single source of truth for tasks. Create, label, and update issues there.
2. Document durable findings in the appropriate `knowledge/` file
3. Update `ROADMAP.md` only for strategic changes
4. Do not silently fix without documenting why
5. Do not create new files in `dev/` for task tracking — use GitHub Issues

Carl is the product owner. commaBot is the engineering team and PM.
