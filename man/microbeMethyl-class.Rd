An S4 class to represent adenine methylation (6mA) data from a single
bacterial sample, particularly in E. coli. This class stores methylation
data (beta values and number of reads), sample name, and sample metadata.

methylation levels for each genomic position.}

\item{\code{num_reads}}{An integer vector of read counts for each genomic
position, representing the number of reads covering each position.}
