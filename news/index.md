# Changelog

## comma 0.6.0

### New features

- **[`mValues()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/mValues.md)**
  — new exported function that converts per-site beta values and read
  depths into M-values using the formula
  `log2((M_reads + alpha) / (U_reads + alpha))` with a default
  pseudocount of `alpha = 0.5`. M-values are variance-stabilized
  relative to raw beta values and are better suited for distance-based
  analyses such as PCA.

- **[`plot_pca()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_pca.md)**
  now internally transforms beta values to M-values via
  [`mValues()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/mValues.md)
  before running PCA, improving separation of samples with
  heteroscedastic methylation profiles.

### Bioconductor submission preparation

- Version bumped to 0.6.0 for Bioconductor submission preparation.

- Package passes `R CMD check` with zero code-level errors or warnings.
  Remaining check notes are environment-specific (locale, pdflatex
  availability) and will not be present in Bioconductor’s check
  infrastructure.

- Full `roxygen2` documentation for all exported functions, including
  `\donttest{}` examples throughout.

## comma 0.5.0

### Major new features

- **[`plot_methylation_distribution()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_methylation_distribution.md)**
  — beta value density plot per sample, coloured by sample name, and
  faceted by modification type when multiple types are present. Useful
  for QC and comparing methylation level distributions.

- **[`plot_genome_track()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_genome_track.md)**
  — genome browser-style scatter plot of methylation beta values
  vs. genomic position. Supports positional windowing via `start`/ `end`
  arguments, `mod_type` filtering, and optional feature annotation
  rectangles from `annotation(object)`.

- **[`plot_metagene()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_metagene.md)**
  — average methylation profile across a class of genomic features,
  normalized to fractional position \[0 = TSS, 1 = TTS\]. Uses
  `annotateSites(type = "metagene")` internally.

- **[`plot_volcano()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_volcano.md)**
  — volcano plot for differential methylation results. Accepts the
  `data.frame` output of
  [`results()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/results.md).
  Colors points as Hypermethylated, Hypomethylated, or Not significant
  based on user-supplied `padj_threshold` and `delta_beta_threshold`.

- **[`plot_heatmap()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_heatmap.md)**
  — `geom_tile` heatmap of the top differentially methylated sites
  (ranked by adjusted p-value) across all samples. Uses `ggplot2` only;
  no `ComplexHeatmap` dependency required.

- **[`plot_pca()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_pca.md)**
  — PCA of per-sample methylation profiles using
  [`stats::prcomp()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/prcomp.html). Points
  colored and optionally shaped by any column in `sampleInfo(object)`.

- **[`plot_coverage()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_coverage.md)**
  — histogram of sequencing depth per site, per sample. Useful for
  coverage QC before differential methylation testing.

### Documentation

- Added **two vignettes** required for Bioconductor submission:
  - `"Getting Started with comma"` — end-to-end workflow using
    `comma_example_data`.
  - `"Working with Multiple Modification Types"` — joint 6mA + 5mC
    analysis.
- Added **package-level documentation**
  ([`?comma`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/comma-package.md))
  describing the overall workflow.

### Dependency changes

- Added `BiocStyle`, `ComplexHeatmap`, `ggrepel`, and `patchwork` to
  `Suggests`. None are required for core functions; `patchwork` enables
  combined annotation tracks in
  [`plot_genome_track()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_genome_track.md)
  and
  [`plot_heatmap()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/plot_heatmap.md).

- Added `VignetteBuilder: knitr` to DESCRIPTION.

- Added `Visualization` to `biocViews`.

## comma 0.4.0

### Major new features

- **[`diffMethyl()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/diffMethyl.md)**
  — the core differential methylation function. Accepts a `commaData`
  object and a design formula, tests each methylation site for
  differential methylation between conditions, and returns the object
  enriched with per-site statistics in `rowData`. Supports two
  statistical backends:

  - `method = "beta_binomial"` (default): per-site quasibinomial GLM via
    base R [`stats::glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html). No extra
    packages required.
  - `method = "methylkit"`: wraps
    [`methylKit::calculateDiffMeth()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/methylKit/man/calculateDiffMeth-methods.html)
    for users who prefer the methylKit pipeline. Requires `methylKit` to
    be installed.

  New `rowData` columns: `dm_pvalue`, `dm_padj` (Benjamini-Hochberg by
  default), `dm_delta_beta` (effect size: treatment minus control mean
  beta), and one `dm_mean_beta_<condition>` column per condition level.
  Analysis parameters are stored in
  `metadata(object)$diffMethyl_params`.

- **[`results()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/results.md)**
  — S4 method to extract differential methylation results from a
  `commaData` object as a tidy `data.frame`. Supports optional
  `mod_type` filtering.

- **[`filterResults()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/filterResults.md)**
  — S4 method to filter the results table by adjusted p-value (`padj`)
  and absolute effect size (`delta_beta`) thresholds.

- **[`.parseDorado()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-parseDorado.md)
  — full Dorado BAM parser** replacing the previous stub. Reads MM/ML
  base modification tags from Dorado-aligned BAM files using
  [`Rsamtools::scanBam()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Rsamtools/man/scanBam.html),
  parses modification positions from CIGAR-decoded read coordinates, and
  aggregates per-read calls into per-site beta values. Supports 6mA,
  5mC, and 4mC in the same BAM file. Invoked automatically by
  `commaData(..., caller = "dorado")`.

### Dependency changes

- **Added** `methylKit` to `Suggests`. Required only for
  `diffMethyl(..., method = "methylkit")`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## comma 0.3.0

### Major new features

- **[`annotateSites()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/annotateSites.md)**
  — new vectorized annotation function that replaces
  `annotateMethylSites()`, `annotateTSS()`, and `annotateTTS()`. Accepts
  a `commaData` object and uses
  [`GenomicRanges::findOverlaps()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/IRanges/man/findOverlaps-methods.html)
  internally — no nested for-loops. Supports three annotation modes:

  - `type = "overlap"`: assigns feature type and name to each site;
    non-overlapping sites are labelled `"intergenic"`.
  - `type = "proximity"`: reports the nearest feature, its distance (in
    bp), and a signed relative position relative to the feature’s TSS.
  - `type = "metagene"`: reports a fractional position (0–1) within the
    overlapping feature, strand-aware. Returns an updated `commaData`
    with new columns in `rowData`.

- **[`slidingWindow()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/slidingWindow.md)**
  — new generalised sliding window function that replaces
  `methylRollingMedian()` and `methylRollingMean()`. Accepts a
  `commaData` object; genome size is always read from `genome(object)` —
  no hardcoded values. Supports `stat = "median"` or `stat = "mean"`,
  per-sample output, `mod_type` filtering, and circular genome
  wrap-around. Returns a tidy `data.frame`.

- **[`methylomeSummary()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/methylomeSummary.md)**
  — new function that computes per-sample summary statistics
  (mean/median/SD of beta values, fraction methylated, mean/median
  coverage). Returns a tidy `data.frame` suitable for `ggplot2` or
  tabular reporting. Supports `mod_type` filtering.

- **[`coverageDepth()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/coverageDepth.md)**
  — new function that bins the genome into non-overlapping windows and
  computes mean or median sequencing depth per window per sample.
  Replaces `calculateMethylSiteDepth()`. Returns a tidy `data.frame`.

- **[`varianceByDepth()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/varianceByDepth.md)**
  — new function that computes per-sample methylation variance as a
  function of sequencing depth. Replaces `varByCoverage()`. Accepts a
  `commaData` object; no hardcoded column names. Returns a tidy
  `data.frame`.

- **[`writeBED()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/writeBED.md)**
  — rewritten from scratch. Accepts a `commaData` object, an output
  path, and a sample name. Removes all hardcoded developer paths and
  chromosome names. Writes a standard BED9 file with an optional
  blue-to-red `itemRGB` methylation scale.

### Breaking changes

- **`annotateMethylSites()`**, **`annotateTSS()`**, and
  **`annotateTTS()`** have been removed. Use
  [`annotateSites()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/annotateSites.md)
  instead.

- **`methylRollingMedian()`** and **`methylRollingMean()`** have been
  removed. Use
  [`slidingWindow()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/slidingWindow.md)
  instead.

- **`calculateMethylSiteDepth()`** and **`varByCoverage()`** have been
  removed (they were not exported). Use
  [`coverageDepth()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/coverageDepth.md)
  and
  [`varianceByDepth()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/varianceByDepth.md)
  instead.

### Package changes

- Root-level clutter removed: `functions.R`, `testscript.R`,
  `WT_6mA_Mg.txt`, `WT_6mA_all_callers.txt`, `all_site_annotations.txt`,
  and `all_site_annotations_60p.txt` have been deleted.

- `methylKitGATC.R` (historical analysis script) moved to
  `inst/scripts/methylKitGATC_historical.R` with a descriptive header
  comment. It is not part of the package.

- Version bumped to `0.3.0`.

### Dependency changes

- **Added** `GenomeInfoDb` to `Imports` (was transitively available but
  is now explicitly declared).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## comma 0.2.0

### Major new features

- Added `commaData` S4 class (extends `SummarizedExperiment`) — the
  central data object for all comma analyses. Stores methylation beta
  values and coverage as assay matrices with per-site and per-sample
  metadata.

- Added
  [`commaData()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/commaData.md)
  constructor: parses one or more modkit pileup BED files (or Megalodon
  files) and merges them into a `commaData` object with consistent site
  × sample matrices. Supports multi-sample, multi-modification-type
  data.

- Added modkit parser
  ([`.parseModkit()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-parseModkit.md)):
  reads modkit `pileup` BED output (primary ONT methylation calling
  format). Supports all three modification types: 6mA (`a`), 5mC (`m`),
  and 4mC (`21839`).

- Added Megalodon parser
  ([`.parseMegalodon()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-parseMegalodon.md)):
  reads legacy Megalodon per-read BED output for backward compatibility
  with existing datasets.

- Added Dorado BAM parser stub
  ([`.parseDorado()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-parseDorado.md)):
  not yet implemented; provides a clear error message directing users to
  use `modkit pileup` first.

- Added
  [`findMotifSites()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/findMotifSites.md):
  locates all instances of a DNA sequence motif (e.g., GATC, CCWGG) in a
  genome (BSgenome object or FASTA file) and returns a `GRanges` of all
  positions on both strands.

- Added
  [`loadAnnotation()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/loadAnnotation.md):
  reads GFF3 or BED annotation files and returns a `GRanges` with
  standardized `feature_type` and `name` metadata columns.

- Added accessor functions:
  [`methylation()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/methylation.md),
  `coverage()`,
  [`sampleInfo()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/sampleInfo.md),
  [`siteInfo()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/siteInfo.md),
  [`modTypes()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/modTypes.md),
  `genome()`, `annotation()`,
  [`motifSites()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/motifSites.md).

- Added subsetting: `[` for sites/samples and
  [`subset()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/subset.md)
  for filtering by `mod_type`, `condition`, or `chrom`.

- Added internal genome utilities:
  [`.validateGenomeInfo()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-validateGenomeInfo.md),
  [`.circularIndex()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-circularIndex.md),
  [`.makeSeqinfo()`](https://carl-stone.github.io/comma/reference/dot-makeSeqinfo.md).

### Data changes

- **Removed** all 9 MG1655-specific bundled datasets (`data/*.rda`).
  These were specific to *E. coli* K-12 MG1655 and not usable with other
  organisms.

- **Added** `comma_example_data`: a synthetic `commaData` object with a
  simulated 100 kb genome, 3 samples (2 conditions), and two
  modification types (6mA and 5mC). Used in vignettes and tests. Run
  `data-raw/create_example_data.R` to regenerate.

- **Added** `inst/extdata/example_modkit.bed`: small modkit pileup BED
  for constructor tests and examples.

- **Added** `inst/extdata/example.gff3`: matching GFF3 annotation for
  the example genome.

### Dependency changes

- **Added** to `Imports`: `GenomicRanges`, `SummarizedExperiment`,
  `IRanges`, `S4Vectors`, `BiocGenerics`, `Rsamtools`, `zoo`

- **Added** to `Suggests`: `BSgenome`, `Biostrings`, `rtracklayer`

- **Removed** from `Imports`: `forcats`

### Package changes

- Package renamed from `CoMMA` to `comma` (Comparative Methylomics for
  Microbial Analysis). The new name reflects the broader scope — all
  modification types (6mA, 5mC, 4mC), not just adenine methylation.

- Version bumped to `0.2.0`.

- `R (>= 4.1.0)` is now the minimum R version requirement.

- Added `biocViews` field in preparation for Bioconductor submission.

### Notes

- The existing functions `annotateMethylSites()`, `annotateTSS()`, and
  `methylRollingMedian()` are preserved but unchanged. They do not yet
  accept `commaData` objects and retain their known limitations (nested
  for-loops, hardcoded genome size). These will be replaced in Phase 3
  (v0.3.0).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## comma 0.1.0

- Initial release as `CoMMA` (Comparison of Microbial Methylated
  Adenines).
- Exported functions: `annotateMethylSites()`, `annotateTSS()`,
  `methylRollingMedian()`.
- Data: 9 MG1655-specific `.rda` datasets.
